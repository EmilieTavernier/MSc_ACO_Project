# Ant Colony Optimisation Demonstration Software

Author: Emilie Tavernier

The Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) demonstration software is an educational tool demonstrating ACO algorithms usage in a variety of problems (traveling salesman problem, job scheduling and edge detection).
This project was realised for a dissertation for the degree of MSc. Artificial Intelligence at Heriot Watt University (Scotland)

## Getting Started

This software is accessible as a web app at this address: https://emilietavernier.github.io/MSc_ACO_Project/#/
The desktop version (windows only) is contained in the folder "aco_windows_release" (run the executable file .exe to launch the app). 
For better performance, the desktop version is advised.

## Setting up the development environment

This is an open-source project. You are free to copy the code and expand on it. 
Here is the set up I used for my development environment:
- Install IntelliJ IDE
- Install Flutter SDK
- In IntelliJ, install Dart and Flutter plugins
- Create a new flutter project (check web platform box)
- For desktop development, use in terminal:
    $ flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
    $ flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
    $ flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
- For Web, Chrome or Edge are the default supported browser
