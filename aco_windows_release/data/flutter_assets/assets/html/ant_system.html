   Ant System (AS) was the first ant colony optimisation algorithm proposed. 
   It was developed by Dorigo, Maniezzo and Colorni in 1991 to solve the 
   <b>Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</b>. The general structure is as follow:   
</p>

   &emsp;&ensp; 
   The stopping solution generally refers to a <b>maximum number of 
   iteration</b> (running time) or a <b>stagnation state</b>
   (no improvements during n solutions). Each ant is assigned to a <b>random 
   departure node</b>.
</p>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   During an iteration, each ant constructs a solution step by step until the 
   tour is completed. The probability for an ant k on node i to visit node j
   next is computed with the following formula:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/cityProba.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   <b>&#945;</b> and <b>&#946;</b> are parameters to control the weight of 
   pheromone and distance between cities on next destination decision. 
   During the destination selection, a greater <b>&#945;</b> means that 
   edges with <b>lot of pheromones</b> will be favoured, while a 
   greater <b>&#946;</b> will privilege <b>closest cities</b>.
</p>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   The pheromone concentration for edge ij is updated via the following 
   formula:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/pheromoneUpdate.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   The <b>evaporation rate</b>, [0; 1), allows to forget paths overtime. 
   If it is low, ants will be slow, and may fail, to converge to a common path. 
   If it is high, they will be quick to converge but may settle too rapidly to 
   a suboptimal solution.
</p>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   At each iteration, each ant adds new pheromones on the edges they 
   used in their solution. It is described by the following formula:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/pheromoneDelta.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   Rising <b>Q</b> will result in bigger pheromone addition to reenforce 
   more an edge each time an ant uses it. However, this may lead to a 
   snowball effect where the favourite path will quickly outshine all other 
   solution, and result in premature convergence.
