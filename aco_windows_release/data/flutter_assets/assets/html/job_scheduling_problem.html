   The job scheduling problem (JSP) is a common problem in computer science. 
   Several variants exist with more or less constraints but the main idea is 
   as follows: 
</p>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   A set of jobs needs to be executed. Each job is composed of a set of tasks 
   of varying duration which needs to be performed in a specific order 
   (<b>precedence constraint</b>). Tasks from the same job can only be executed 
   one at a time on a specific machine from a given set (resources). The goal 
   is to <b>minimize the makespan</b>, that is the time to complete the 
   whole process from start to end.
</p>

<p>
   Example:
</p>

<p>
   Letâ€™s consider a set of three jobs composed of two to three tasks. 
   A task is described by the machine it needs to be executed on, and 
   its duration as follow: <b>(machine, duration)</b>. 
</p>

<p>
   Given the following jobs:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      job 0 = [(0,3), (1,2), (2, 2)]
   </li> 
   <li>
      job 1 = [(0,2), (2,1), (1, 4)]
   </li> 
   <li>
      job 2 = [(1,4), (2,3)]
   </li> 
</ul>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   The next two schedules for machines M0, M1 and M2 are both feasible but 
   the second one having a shorter makespan is the best option.
