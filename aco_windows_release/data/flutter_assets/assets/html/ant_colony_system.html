   Ant Colony System (ACS) is a variant of ACO proposed by Dorigo and 
   Gambardella in 1996. The main difference with AS and MMAS is that it relies 
   on <b>two kind of pheromone updates</b>:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      A <b>local update</b> performed by each ant on its last visited edge, 
      at each construction step. This one involves a decay coefficient.
   </li> 
   <li>
      An <b>offline update</b> at the end of an iteration. 
      Similarly to MMAS, this one is performed only by the best ant 
      (best-so-far or iteration-best).
   </li> 
</ul>
<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   The formula for the local update is as follow: 
</p>


<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/ACSlocalUpdate.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   And the formula for the offline update:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/ACSofflineUpdate.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   With:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/ACSdelta.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   Another notable difference between ACS and the other ACO variant concerns 
   the selection of the next destination during the construction of a solution. 
   In ACS, it involves a pseudorandom proportional rule where the probability 
   depends on a random variable <b>q uniformly distributed on [0,1]</b>. 
   A parameter <b>q0</b> serves as a <b>threshold</b> to choose the next 
   destination.
</p>
   
<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   If <b>q <= q0</b>, the next destination j is the city for which edge ij
   has the greatest product between its pheromone concentration and its 
   heuristic information weighted with the exponent <b>&#946;</b>.  
</p>
   
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/ACSdestinationSelectMethod1.PNG'/>
</div>
   
<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   A <b>&#946;</b> of zero means we will choose the edge with the greatest 
   pheromone concentration. Rising <b>&#946;</b> will add more weight to 
   heuristic information to favour cities that are close to each other. 
</p>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   If <b>q > q0</b>, the same method as in Ant System (AS) is used to 
   choose the next destination. The probability for an ant k on node i to 
   visit node j next is computed with the following formula:. 
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/ACSdestinationSelectMethod2.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   Again, <b>&#945;</b> and <b>&#946;</b> are parameters to control the weight 
   of pheromone and distance between cities on next destination decision. 
   If <b>&#945; equals 0</b>, we will use the edge with the <b>greatest 
   amount of pheromones</b>, if <b>&#946; equals 0</b>, we will chose the 
   <b>closest city</b>.
