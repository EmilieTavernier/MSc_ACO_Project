   Ant Colony System (ACS) was initially proposed to solve TSP but can be adapt 
   really easily to job scheduling with a few tweaks.

   The first difference to takes into account is that we have JSP required 
   the respect of <b>precedence constraint</b>. This play during the 
   construction of a solution when selecting the next destination:   
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/ACS_JSP_proba.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   The second difference concerns the <b>heuristic information</b> associated 
   to the edges ij. Here, we donâ€™t have a physical distance between nodes as 
   in TSP. Instead, we define a <b>machine delay</b> as the time to wait to 
   execute task j on its associated machine. Note that we ignore any additional 
   potential delay caused by the precedence constraint. The machine delay can 
   be translated as the following formula:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/ACS_JSP_machineDelay.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   The heuristic information on edge ij is then defined as <b>the sum of the 
   machine delay and the duration of task j </b> as follow: 
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/ACS_JSP_heuristicInfo.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   Note that this definition is the one we used for this software but it is not 
   the only valid option. You could also define the heuristic information as 
   <b>task j duration</b> to favour the selection of the <b>longest tasks 
   first</b> or as its <b>inverse</b> to favour the <b>shortest tasks first</b>.
