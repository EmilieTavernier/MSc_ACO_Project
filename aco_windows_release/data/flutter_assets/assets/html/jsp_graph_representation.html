   &emsp;&ensp; 
   Let’s consider a set of three jobs composed of two to three tasks. A task 
   is described by the machine it needs to be executed on, and its duration 
   as follow: <b>(machine, duration)</b>. 
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      job 0 = [(0,3), (1,2), (2, 2)]
   </li> 
   <li>
      job 1 = [(0,2), (2,1), (1, 4)]
   </li> 
   <li>
      job 2 = [(1,4), (2,3)]
   </li> 
</ul>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   This problem can be represented as a graph suitable to ACO. Each job 
   is represented as a set of nodes corresponding to its composing tasks. 
   Tasks from the same job must be executed in a given order (<b>precedence 
   constraint</b>) so we connect them unidirectionally. Tasks form different 
   jobs are all connected bidirectionally. We add a starting node to serve as 
   departure point for all ants. 
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/JSPgraph.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   An ant constructs a solution by <b>visiting all nodes exactly once</b>. 
   To respect the precedence constraint, the ant cannot visit a node if 
   its same job predecessors haven’t been visited. For instance, the ant 
   cannot go to job 3 task (2,3) before job 3 task (1,4). 
</p>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   After completing a solution, we can translate it to an actual schedule 
   by respecting the order of the execution of tasks (order in which they 
   were visited) on their respective machine. 
</p>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   Here is a complete solution:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/JSPgraphPath.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   And the corresponding schedule:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/JSPgraphSchedule.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   A solution is evaluated based on the <b>makespan</b> of the corresponding 
   schedule (the shorter, the better).
