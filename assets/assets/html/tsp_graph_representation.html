   Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithms are generally used to solve 
   discrete problems represented as graphs.

   TSP can be represented as an <b>undirected weighted graph</b> 
   where cities are vertices, and paths connecting them are edges. 
   The weight of each edge corresponds to the length of the path. 
   Ants can only travel and laid pheromones on these edges.

   &emsp;&ensp; 
   In this demonstration, edges' <b>opacity is proportional to the
   pheromone concentration</b> for the current iteration. 
   The darkest is an edge, the more chance ants will take it.
