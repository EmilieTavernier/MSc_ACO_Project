   &emsp;&ensp; Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithms draw inspiration from 
   <b>antsâ€™ foraging behaviour</b>. The process is as follows: an ant scouts 
   the environment around the colony looking for food; If it found some, 
   it will go back to the colony while dropping <b>pheromones</b> on its way; 
   These pheromones attract others ants, leading them to the food; 
   On their way back, they will themselves reinforce the track. 
   As a natural consequence, shorter paths will be favoured as more 
   ants will complete it in a shorter amount of time, thus reinforcing them 
   with pheromones quicker. Longer paths will be forgotten as pheromones 
   gradually fade away.

   &emsp;&ensp; This mechanism allowing individual agents to cooperate by 
   modifying the environment is called <b>stigmergy</b>. Using this mechanism, 
   a problem    can be solved bit by bit. In this case, the ants leave markers 
   which are not a solution by themselves but which will influence the group 
   so that it ultimately finds an optimal answer.

   &emsp;&ensp; Many variants of ACO have been applied to solve various problem. 
   This software demonstrates three of the most famous variants 
   (<b>Ant System</b>, <b>Min-Max Ant System</b> and <b>Ant Colony System</b>) 
   applied on the <b>travelling salesman problem</b>, <b>job scheduling</b> 
   and <b>edge detection</b>.
