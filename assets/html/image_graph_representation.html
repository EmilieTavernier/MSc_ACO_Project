   A grayscale image can be represented as a <b>M x N matrix</b> of pixels. 
   To adapt our problem to ACO, we represent our image as a graph where pixels
   are nodes connected to adjacent pixels.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <image alt='image not found' src='asset:assets/images/imageGraph.PNG'/>
</div>

<p>
   &emsp;&ensp; 
   This configuration is quite similar to TSP. However, TSP graph was fully 
   connected while our image is represented as <b>partially connected 
   graph</b>: an ant can only travel from one pixel to a direct neighbour.

   &emsp;&ensp; 
   In TSP, a solution was evaluated according to its length (the shorter, 
   the better). Here, we substitute the length by a heuristic information 
   derived from the <b>intensity variation</b> (the higher the better) along 
   a given path.
